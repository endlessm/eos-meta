# The eos-dev package is intended to be installed by developers after
# converting the system away from ostree.
#
# Packages listed here should be commonly used, of high value for
# development, and expected to be relevant to a whole group of Endless
# developers.
#
# If it's a tool that's only really useful to you, or you only
# expect it to be used occasionally, then it probably doesn't belong
# here. But do consider adding it to eos-dev-suggests so that it
# doesn't get purged from the distro.
