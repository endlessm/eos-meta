# The eos-toolbox-dev package is intended to be included in the eos-toolbox
# container images as a way to provide the base development packages needed
# for common development.
#
# Packages listed here should be commonly used, of high value for
# development, and expected to be relevant to a whole group of Endless
# developers.
#
# Some packages included in the eos-dev package (e.g. gnome dev packages)
# are not included here on purpose given they increase the container image
# size quite substantially. Developers that need the extra packages can
# still install them manually using apt-get from an eos-toolbox container.
